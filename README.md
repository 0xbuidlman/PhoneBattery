# PhoneBattery
PhoneBattery is a simple utility that lets you check your phone's battery life on your Apple Watch. It is very simple and doesn't do anything else than that.

PhoneBattery is also **available for free** on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phonebattery-your-phones-battery/id1009278300?ls=1&mt=8)!

I had the initial idea for this app on the plane from WWDC back to Germany, polished it at home and here it is now.

Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to keep this app updated. So, if you are interested help me updating PhoneBattery!

Starting with PhoneBattery 2.0, you can optionally support its development by buying the IAP for $0.99. This is less than a cup of coffee and will help me maintain PhoneBattery. PhoneBattery will _stay free_ though. The only benefit of the IAP is the unlocking of new app icons.

### System Requirements

* Requires iOS 9 or newer
* Requires watchOS 2 or newer

You can also download an old build [here](https://github.com/marcelvoss/PhoneBattery/releases/tag/1.0.2), that is compatible to iOS 8 and watchOS 1.
