# PhoneBattery
PhoneBattery is a simple utility that lets you check your phone's battery life on your Apple Watch. It is very simple and doesn't do anything else than that.

PhoneBattery is also **available for free** on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phonebattery-your-phones-battery/id1009278300?ls=1&mt=8)! Please leave a rating, if you like PhoneBattery!

* battery status notifications 
* two different watch interfaces to choose from
* display your phone's battery level on your Apple Watch
* battery states such as low power, charging, low battery etc.
* no ads, no IAPs
