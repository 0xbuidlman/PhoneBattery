# PhoneBattery
PhoneBattery is a simple utility that lets you check your phone's battery life on your Apple Watch. It is very simple and doesn't do anything else than that.

This app is available in three languages: German, English and French (thanks to [@juliastic](https://github.com/juliastic) for localizing it).

PhoneBattery is also available for free on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phonebattery-your-phones-battery/id1009278300?ls=1&mt=8)!

I had the idea for this on the plane back from WWDC to Germany, polished it at home and here it is now.
